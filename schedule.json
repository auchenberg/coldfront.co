This has led to widespread frustration, a lot of wasted time, and many stupid error messages. This is a talk both about how that happened and why it's time to change. About what it actually means to design, structure and build an offline-first app. About the benefits, opportunities and challenges of the approach, and how it can make your apps faster, more fun, and more robust.</p>"
