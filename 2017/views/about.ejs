			<h2>About</h2>
			
			<p>We started ColdFront to build a front-end community in Copenhagen, and we aim to help underrepresented groups in tech. This includes but isnâ€™t limited to: immigrants, students, people of color, LGBTQIA+ people, disabled people and alike. We would like to give welcome you to our community!</p>

			<p>At ColdFront we pay our speakers a honorarium in addition to covering travel expenses, and this year we have teamed up with the employees of some amazing companies who have agree to donate their speaker honorariums into a <strong>limited number of free, diversity sponsored tickets for ColdFront and Copenhagen Techfestival.</strong></p>
