			<h2>About ColdFront</h2>
			
			<p>We started <a href="https://kenneth.io/blog/2014/04/09/introducing-coldfront-conference/">ColdFront back in 2014</a> to flourish the front-end community and to put Copenhagen the global front-end map. </p>
            
            <p>Back in 2014 we had travel to other major european cities such as Amsterdam, London, Berlin, London, New York and San Francisco to be a part of our global front-end community, but with ColdFront we changed that.</p>

            <p>ColdFront is a conference for front-end developers who are passionate about building user experiences with the latest and most relevant technologies. Over the past years the term “front-end” has transitioned from meaning building experiences for the web, to be covering a broad span of platforms, devices and runtimes.</p>

            <p>ColdFront is a conference that aims to be at the forefront of technology curve by providing inspirational content about tomorrow's challenges and technologies.</p>

            <h3>Our format</h3>

            <p>ColdFront is a single-track conference, and a ColdFront talk is maximum 45 minutes long. After each 2 session block, a 15 min break will follow to allow attendees to stretch their legs.</p>

			
            <h3>Our principles and manifest</h3>

            <p>To guide the content for ColdFront we have outlined the following principles that helps us decide what content that is relevant for the conference.</p>

            <h4>Why instead of how</h4>
            <p>We want to hear talks that focuses on the “why” instead of the practical “how”. By this we mean that we would rather hear a talk that provides the reasons and perspective on a given technology or framework, than the “how to” on how to use the technology or framework. </p>
            
            <h4>Perspective over tutorials</h4>
            <p>We want talks that provides perspective, new ways of thinking, and puts today’s landscape into the perspective of tomorrow. If the content can be read in a tutorial, it’s not a ColdFront talk.</p>

            <h4>Technologies and trends</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Web platform / browsers / W3C / WHATWG / runtimes</li>
                <li>React / VueJS / Modern front-end frameworks</li>
