I help to share the latest possibilities for web apps by coding demos, writing articles and speaking. Previously I was a full stack developer back before “full stack” was a thing, gradually focusing more on the front-end as browsers grew more advanced. In Pearson's Future Technologies team, I helped the world's biggest education company to innovate with new web and native technologies. At pebble {code} I led the development of a hybrid Bluetooth app for a global logistics company. But my biggest tech love is the web - I got very excited about HTML5 around 2010 and I've been mostly geeking out about web APIs ever since!",
