While those are impressive, there are some more interesting metrics that we need to talk about.\n\n Did you know that 43% of the humans on this planet have access to the internet, but 57% do not? Did you know that in 2016 India brought 100 million NEW users to the internet for the very first time? When you take a glance into the current state of global connectivity, you might realise that the internet you think you know so well exists on an entirely different plane.\n\n Through the guise of user-experience and empathy, we’ll study the state of global connectivity, connection speeds, population, and the costs of data in order to re-centre how we think about our role as designers and developers for the web today.",

This stuff is definitely in the future type stuff, but learning about it now will prepare attendees for what they can expect browsers to be capable of doing in the upcoming years.",
